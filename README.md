This application was built using java 17.
## Chatlog
This is the conversation with ChatGPT for building the application

### Was it easy to complete the task using AI?
ChatGPT helped to automate many repetitive tasks, for example writing the controllers, but most of the time I still had to tweak some parts of the code to make it work as intended.

### How long did the task take you to complete? 
Even though chatgpt helped reduce a lot of time with large and repetitive code, I still had to invest time into figuring out how some of the code worked and fix it myself to get the result I
was looking for.

### Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
Most of the time the code was not right away able to be copied and run; most of the times it was because of variables that ChatGPT named differently than mine, or sometimes it would invoke
methods that did not really exist, so I had to figure out which variable it was supposed to be using and try to come up with another method implementation.

### Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?
I struggled mostly during the geneartion of the unit test, and I think it is because I havent had much experience on them and the code that ChatGPT was giving me was not 100% working so I
could not really figure out how to fix it right away. So even thogugh ChatGPT does a lot of work for you, you still need to have a strong fundamental knowledge of the code you are requesting.

### Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?
I learned that you can provide code snippets inside """ """ triple quotation marks, and in that way ChatGPT can separate it from your prompt and be more efficient.
